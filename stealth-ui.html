              This page seems as convenient a place as any to hold my thoughts on <strong>how to
              develop tools that can be used to further the pursuit of a human-like AGI</strong>

              The following can be thought of as a brainstorm, or even as a mood board,
              moreso than as any sort of proposal for action. I make no claim that the
              ideas herein are actionable, reasonable, or good, and I leave it
              to the reader to make their own conjecture as to the best approach to
              interacting with robot brains.

          The task is to develop tools that will be used by a group of people
          <strong>much smarter than me,</strong> to tinker with something that is
          <strong>much smarter than them.</strong> My gut reaction is to stick to
          what I know; to lean on my area of greatest expertise... But
          unfortunately, I don't have one of those, so a different approach is needed:
        </p>
        <p>
          My first source of inspiration comes from biology. If a digital intelligence
          is meant to have characteristics similar to those of a human, then perhaps
          a sensible place to start is to examine how we learn about and tinker with humans.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
          Despite dealing with a system that is not particularly easy to debug,
          physicians and medical researchers have developed a diverse <s>bag of hacks</s>
          toolkit of techniques to peer into the inner workings of the human
          body, and sometimes to make modifications to its normal functioning.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, while the typical tools of technology and industry can be used
          to melt, bend, grind, or otherwise coerce materials to match the vision
          of engineers, <strong>the tools of medicine can't force an organism to behave in one way or
          another,</strong> and trying too hard to do so will often simply upset and destroy
          the delicate system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather, medical tools must apply only the slightest, most tactful nudge.
          It's no coincidence that other disciplines, from military to manufacturing,
          borrow terminology from medicine when they describe any sort of extremely
          delicate operation as <strong>"surgically precise."</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps the tools used to interact with a complex digital intelligence
          ought to be created with the same attentiveness and humility.

        <h2>Inspiration From Medicine</h2>
        <hr class="line" />
        <p>
          The human body is doing exactly 10,000 things<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
          at any given time, and observing these processes can
          give us clues about the state of the system.
        </p>
        <p>
          A common theme in medical diagnostics, then, is in choosing a specific thing
          to measure, and then amplifying that signal, thereby bringing it to the
          forefront of the examiner's attention. Sometimes, we can do that fairly
          directly, like when we take someone's pulse; Other times, we're
          interested in a more elusive signal. In that case, we need a clever way
          to coax it into a form that is convenient to measure, so we might
          feel compelled to do something like, say, inject a patient with
          radioactive material so we can measure where the gamma rays shoot out.
        </p>
        <p>
          For real. Let's talk about that.
        </p>
        <div class="row">
          <h3 id="radiopharm">Radiopharmaceuticals and SPECT scans</h3>
          <h4 class="subtitle-muted">Or: Injecting a patient with radioactive material so we can measure where the gamma rays shoot out</h4>
          <div class="col-left">
            <p>
              A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_emission_computed_tomography">SPECT scan</a>
              is a versatile tool for monitoring biological activity. Normally, things found in
              the human body do not emit gamma rays, and for good reason, but
              if one of those things did, it would be very convenient to observe
              how that particular thing behaves in the body.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's great news, because we can actually attach radioactive particles to
              nearly anything that we might be interested in following (like a sugar
              molecule, a particular hormone, or even a living cell), and then set it
              free in the body.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is called "radiolabeling," and it's a great
              way to debug things like internal bleeding (because you can inject it),
              or lung dysfunction (because you can snort it).
            </p>
          </div>
            <div class="col-right">
              <img src="spect.jpg">
              <p class="caption">A SPECT scan measuring blood flow</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>
              The radiolabeled thing goes on to do what it was going to do anyway, but now
              it's loudly spraying gamma rays all over the place, so we can see
              it clearly with a SPECT scanner. Then, we can compare what we see with
              our expectation of what should happen according to our hypothesis,
              and determine whether:
              <ol>
                <li>Everything is okay</li>
                <li>Something is wrong</li>
                <li>We've learned something new</li>
              </ol>
              This pattern of <strong>passing a "loud" carrier signal through the system
              and then observing its behavior</strong>, is instructive as a tactic
              for interacting with any complex, autonomous system. I see the tools
              used to interact with a sophisticated AGI as <strong>a thin layer of visibility
              on top of a tremendously deep (but mostly opaque) system</strong>, much like
              the tools of medical diagnosis.

        <p>
          One of the most profound lessons in human perception that I know of
          came from the alt text of
          <a href="https://xkcd.com/915/">an XKCD comic</a> that has nothing
          to do with data visualization:
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
          <pre>
            "Our brains have just one scale, and we resize our experiences to fit."</pre>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <p>
          We are best equipped to intuitively understand
          <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=loVMMlxC1XoC&pg=PA19&lpg=PA19&dq=%22medium+sized+objects+moving+at+medium+speeds%22&source=bl&ots=eCHb3eqGAW&sig=Us3LS01qG_Pjm4J7rjbE5W6rXN4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj3xq7Mg-XOAhUCymMKHZ95DW8Q6AEIJjAB#v=onepage&q=%22medium%20sized%20objects%20moving%20at%20medium%20speeds%22&f=false">
            "medium-sized objects moving at medium speeds
            through medium distances,"
          </a>
          so data presentation is largely about finding ways to represent
          things in medium magnitudes. I like to think of this as "zoom level."
        </p>
        <p>
          To create a meaningful visualization of something, I think it's helpful
          to look at how others have represented things with similar
          characteristics, and then use that to inspire an approach that suits
          our needs. The first place I thought to look was at neural nets.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="visualizing-how">How people have been visualizing neural networks</h3>
      <p>
        Neural networks seem like a good place to start thinking about how to
        represent what's going on inside of a human-like robot brain. I still don't know
        a whole lot about either of those things, but there is a wealth of literature
        on the tools and techniques used to make them do neat tricks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The question is, <strong>can those techniques be elaborated into more
          powerful, sophisticated tools?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Probably! Of course, I don't know yet what specific problems we want to
        solve, but here are some observations and conjectures.
      </p>

      <h4 id="visualizing-graphs">Deep learning seems to likes conventional graphs</h4>
      <img class="image" src="DL4J_UI.png">
      <p>
        It seems as though right now, people working with neural networks
        are still very reliant on 2D conventional graphs. I like graphs
        <em>alot</em>, but we know that they are not a panacea for all of
        our data woes.
      </p>

            are great for playing with the concept of neural nets, and the way that
            they lay out controls and data may be hints as to how a more
            sophisticated toolset could look.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think it's particularly intuitive how this UI puts its controls
            in "reading order," and the way they use color is effective: Only
            things that represent data get any coloration; configuration and
            controls are otherwise all in grayscale.
          </p>

      <div class="row gap">
        <p>
          Ryerson University's visuslization of a convoluted neural network
          is particularly interesting, because it addresses one of my initial
          thoughts about representing data in 3D:
        </p>
        <div class="row" align="center">
        <pre><em>Is 3D EVER a good idea for a visualization?</em></pre>
      </div>
        <div align="center" class="row">
          <img class="image" src="ryerson-3d-vis.png">
        </div>
        <p>
          While I still think that <em>most</em> of the time, making a
          visualization 3D adds distracting complexity, I'm convinced now that a
          full 3D representation could actually be meaningful in this sort of
          application. Good work, Ryerson.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h4 id="visualizing-sucks">Those aren't good enough, though</h4>
      <p>
        These tools don't seem nearly robust enough for complex systems
        with overwhelming amounts of data. I don't know for sure, but my intuition is that the
        current tools used for working with neural nets fall short when they're
        being applied to a <em>general</em> intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
        The interactive visualizations are neat, but shallow. They are useful for
        demos, but they don't give any particularly powerful capabilities. I
        feel as though these particular layouts would quickly become cluttered
        and unusable if they were implemented on a large scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        They give us some clues, however, as to some of the characteristics that
        good tools used to interact with a human-like AGI might have:
        <ul>
          <li>Zooming in and out: View the whole system, or focus on one tiny part</li>
          <li>Filtering out information in which we are not interested</li>
          <li>Making both tiny, targeted adjustments, and system-wide configuration changes</li>
          <li>Playing back past system states</li>
          <li>Some fifth thing (I swear I had one...)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        These insights have given me a few ideas as to how these desirable
        functions can be interpereted as features. Here are some rough notes
        on the shapes they could take.
      </p>
      <h3>Fun visualizations that aren't related to AI <em>(yet)</em></h3>
      <h4>Force-directed graphs</h4>
      <div class="row">
        <p>
          Below is a force-directed graph that represents all of the connections
          between the characters in "Les MisÃ©rables." Every time the characters
          share a scene in the script, they are said to have "encountered" one
          another, and a link is formed. If they encounter each other again,
          that link's "value" is increased by one, and the link is made stronger.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like force-directed graphs because every property can carry meaning.
          The software knows what to do without too much "massaging" of the data
          by the user:
          <ul>
            <li>The <strong>color of the nodes</strong> can represent qualitative data, like groupings or categories</li>
            <li>The <strong>size of the nodes</strong> could represent any arbitrary quantitative
              property of the node itself
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The graph below doesn't do this, but in the context of "Les
                  MisÃ©rables," perhaps the size of the node could represent the
                  <strong>number of lines</strong> that a character speaks, which might indicate
                  <strong>how important that character is.</strong>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The <strong>length</strong> (and 'springiness!') <strong>of the edges</strong> (lines) represent how strongly two nodes are connected
              <ul>
                <li>Strongly-connected nodes are pulled closer together than weakly-connected nodes.</li>
                <li>Which incidentally helps strongly-connected things group together visually</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>So force-directed graphs provide a convenient way to turn human-unreadable data like this:</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row" align="center">
        <img class="image" src="miserables-json.png">
        <p class="caption">The cast of "Les MisÃ©rables" and all of their encounters with one another, in JSON form</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row" style="padding-top: 50px;">
        <p>
          Into something much more attractive and meaningful:
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row" align="center">
        <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045"><img class="image" src="force-directed-graph.png">
        <p class="caption">Force directed graph in D3.js; Click to try interactive version.</p></a>
      </div>
      <p>
        The rows and rows of headachy data are out of sight, and the information
        overload has completely evaporated. Visualized as a force-directed graph,
        patterns emerge intuitively with minimal cognitive overhead.
        <strong>
          The story that the data wants to tell has started to come
          into focus.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If we stopped here, we'd be able to determine a few high-level things about
        "Les MisÃ©rables" <strong>at a glance.</strong> If you are familiar with
        the story (I'm not), you might even be able to guess which characters
        are represented by some of the nodes. Not so much with the JSON data.
      </p>
      <p>
        But more than that, this sort of visualization enables lots of cool
        possibilities for additional interaction. This particular demo doesn't
        let you do much-- You can't even click on nodes to see which character
        they represent, even though that data is present-- but I bet in  30
        seconds, you can think of at least 5 features that you could add to play
        with the data here.
      </p>
      <h4>There are TONS of examples.</h4>
      <p>
        What if we had the tools to not
        just show the current state of the system, but to
        <a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/projects/agot/places.html">replay
          how it has changed over time</a>?
      </p>
      <p>It's likely that you'd also want to be able to
        <a href="http://slodge.com/teach/">filter and group nodes by a variety of criteria</a>.
        </p>
      <p>
        And wouldn't it be handy to <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/929623">
        arbitrarily add nodes with one click</a> or <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4565798">
        click and drag to select them</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know exactly <em>why</em> those features would be desirable,
        but I bet somebody smarter than me does.
        These tools and others like them can all be developed to reduce the
        cognitive load on those expensive PhD. brains, allowing them to focus
        on the problems that they want to solve. Force-directed graphs are just
        one place to start, and I think they look pretty good.

            Web design methodologies often follow the philosophy of "Don't make me think."
            Designers have <em>one</em> particular thing that they want you to
            do on a page-- Post a photo, sign up for a mailing list, buy something...

          So while there are certainly some complex, highly functional web apps
          out there (<a href="hyperdev.com">including full-on software development IDEs</a>),
          conventional web design patterns might be underpowered.
          But there are other places that we can look for suggestions about how
          to visually represent and interact with complex systems.
        </p>
          To me, video games seem like a promising source; particularly management
          simulation and strategy games. However, to explore and elaborate on
          that topic, I'd have to download and play a few of my favorites,
          and that would be a tremendous threat to my productivity this week...

          I want to lay out a few assumptions that would influence the tools and
          libraries that I would think of to build the tools described above.
          Here are a few of them:
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <ul>
          <li>Javascript is the preferred language</li>

          <li>The software should run in any modern browser
            <small>(Chrome, Firefox...)</small></li>

          <li>The software needs to interface with a Python backend</li>

          <li>It will be used by a relatively small number of people
            <ul>
              <li>i.e. It doesn't need to scale like Instagram</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            It does more than just visualize data; it can also be used
            to edit and configure.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          So with that in mind, here are a few thoughts on specific technologies
          that would be fun to use in creating this toolkit.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3 id="coding-visualization">Rad Javascript Libraries</h3>
      <p>
        Modern Javascript is incredibly powerful, and developing impressive
        software is easier than ever with heaps of open-source libraries to
        choose from. Here are a few that I think are relevant to this purpose.
      </p>
      <h4 id="d3js">D3.js</h4>
      <p>
        "D3" stands for "Data-Driven Documents." This is a powerful and versatile
        library that specializes at dynamically rendering data (usually in JSON
        form) on-screen according to the rules of the client-side script. That
        means that you can load data into plain text, and the code arranges it
        dynamically in the browser. It's pretty efficient.
      </p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-left">
          <p>
            D3 is cool because it already supports alot of data-to-graphic functions,
            and there is lots of sample code to help with rapid prototyping. All of
            the data visualization examples above were produced with D3.
          </p>
          <p>
            D3 doesn't particularly excel at data <em>manipulation</em>, but it's
            not inconceivable to extend the library's functionality to support
            that.
          </p>
          <p>
            To see more examples of what D3 can do, check out <a href="d3js.org">d3js.org</a>,
            and don't miss out on the <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery">examples
              page</a>.
            </p>

        <div class="col-right">

      <h4 id="threejs">Three.js</h4>
        <p>Three.js stands for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="anagram">T</span>abulated</li>
            <li><span class="anagram">H</span>euristic</li>

          </ul>
        <p>
          Just kidding. It probably just means "Three" like "Three dimensional."

      <h4 id="babylonjs">Babylon.js</h4>

      </div>
      <h3 id="game-frameworks">Game Frameworks for Interaction</h3>
      <p>
        If typical web tools fall short, game frameworks can be an interesting
        solution to crafting GUIs (*cough* PyGame). Javascript game frameworks
        mostly use HTML5 Canvas to render things, which runs quite quickly,
        but requires <em>alot</em> more work to get things going and to optimize.
        There are <a href="https://html5gameengine.com/">quite a few choices</a>,
        but this is the one that I know the most about:
      </p>
      <h4 id="phaserjs">Phaser.js</h4>
      <p>
        If PyGame was fun, then I feel compelled to point out that
        <a href="phaser.io">Phaser.js</a> exists. It does alot of similar things
        to PyGame, but has the advantage of working in the browser, and also
        simplifies alot of things that you need to build from scratch
        in PyGame.
      </p>
      <div class="row" align="center">
        <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/box2d/car-on-terrain">
          <img src="phaser.gif">
          <p class="caption">Maybe what we need is a truck.</p>
        </a>
      </div>
      <p>
        The Phaser.io <a href="http://phaser.io/examples">Examples section</a>
        has just tons of <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/ship-trail">stuff to play with</a>
        if you want to check it out. I can't think of any practical reason to
        use it now, but if game frameworks are on the table, then Phaser seems
        like a solid candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's got <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/misc/webcam">webcam support</a> too, for some reason.
