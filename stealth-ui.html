              This page seems as convenient a place as any to hold my thoughts on <strong>how to
              develop tools that can be used to further the pursuit of a human-like AGI</strong>
              <em>(Artificial General Intelligence)</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following can be thought of as a brainstorm, or even as a mood board,
              moreso than as any sort of proposal for action. I make no claim that the
              ideas herein are actionable, reasonable, or even sensible, and I leave it
              to the reader to draw their own conclusions as to the best approach to
              interacting with robot brains.
            </p>

        <p>
          The task is to develop tools that will be used by a group of people
          <strong>much smarter than me,</strong> to tinker with something that is
          <strong>much smarter than them.</strong> My gut reaction is to stick to
          what I know; to lean on my area of greatest expertise... But
          unfortunately, I don't have one of those, so a different approach is needed:
        </p>
        <p>
          My first source of inspiration comes from biology. If a digital intelligence
          is meant to have characteristics similar to those of a human, then perhaps
          a sensible place to start is to examine how we learn about and tinker with humans.
        </p>

          <p class="caption">We should wrap the AI in a thermometric chainmail suit, is what I'm suggesting.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Despite dealing with a system that is not particularly easy to debug,
          physicians and medical researchers have developed a diverse <s>bag of hacks</s>
          toolkit of techniques to peer into the inner workings of the human
          body, and sometimes to make modifications to its normal functioning.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, while the typical tools of technology and industry can be used
          to melt, bend, grind, or otherwise coerce materials to match the vision
          of engineers, <strong>the tools of medicine can't force an organism to behave in one way or
          another,</strong> and trying too hard to do so will often simply upset and destroy
          the delicate system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather, medical tools must apply only the slightest, most tactful nudge.
          It's no coincidence, then, that we often describe any sort of extremely
          delicate operation as <strong>"surgically precise."</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps the tools used to interact with a digital intelligence ought to
          be created with the same attentiveness and humility.

        <h2>Inspiration From Medicine</h2>
        <hr class="line" />
        <p>
          The human body is doing exactly 10,000 things simultaneously<sup>[citation needed]</sup>,
          and observing these processes can give us clues about the state of the system.
        </p>
        <p>
          A common theme in medical diagnostics, then, is in choosing a specific thing
          to measure, and then amplifying that signal, thereby bringing it to the
          forefront of the examiner's attention. Sometimes, we can do that fairly
          directly, like when we take someone's pulse... Other times, the signal
          is sufficiently elusive that we need a clever way amplify and measure it.
          In those cases, we might choose to do something like inject a patient with
          radioactive material, and then measure where the gamma rays shoot out.
        </p>
        <p>
          For real. Let's talk about that.
        </p>
        <div class="row">
          <h3 id="radiopharm">Radiopharmaceuticals and SPECT scans</h3>
          <h4 class="subtitle-muted">Or: Injecting a patient with radioactive material and then meaturing where the gamma rays shoot out</h4>
          <div class="col-left">
            <p>
              A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_emission_computed_tomography">SPECT scan</a>
              is a versatile tool for monitoring biological activity. Normally, things found in
              the human body do not emit gamma rays, and for good reason, but
              if one of those things did, it would be very convenient to observe
              how that particular thing behaves in the body.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's great news, because we can actually attach something radioactive to
              nearly anything that we might be interested in following (like a sugar
              molecule, a particular hormone, or even a living cell), and then set it
              free in the body.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is called "radiolabeling," and it's a great
              way to debug things like internal bleeding (because you can inject it),
              or lung dysfunction (because you can snort it). The radiolabeled
              thing goes on to do what it was going to do anyway, but now, because
              it's loudly spraying gamma rays all over the place, we can see it
              clearly with a SPECT scanner.
            </p>
          </div>
            <div class="col-right">
              <img src="spect.jpg">
              <p class="caption">A SPECT scan measuring blood flow</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>
              Then, we can compare what we see with our expectation of what should
              happen according to our hypothesis, and determine whether:
              <ol>
                <li>Everything is okay</li>
                <li>Something is wrong</li>
                <li>We've learned something new</li>
              </ol>
              This pattern of <strong>passing a "loud" carrier signal through the system
              and then observing its effect</strong>, is instructive as a methodology
              for interacting with complex, autonomous systems, and at the very
              least, offers inspiration as to how this information might be visualized
            </p>
          <h3 id="electro">Electricity: Try It On Your Friends</h3>
          <p>
            A favorite technique of human performance researchers and mad scientists,
            gentle amounts of electricity applied to human tissue can tell us neat
            things about how the body functions.
            <a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/neurological/electromyography_emg_92,p07656/">
              Electromyography,
            </a>
            for instance, is used for measuring whether or not nerves are doing what we think they are.
          </p>
          <p>
            More on this later. Eventually I want to talk about probing brains with
            electrodes, but I don't really know where I'm going with this at the moment.

      <h3 id="visualizing-how">How people have been visualizing neural networks</h3>
      <p>
        So far, they've pretty much all been going with histograms or these
        neato interactive visualizations. They're pretty cool.
        I would call these approaches the "technical" approach, and the
        "demonstration" approach.
      </p>

      <h4 id="visualizing-graphs">Normal graphs</h4>
      <img class="image" src="DL4J_UI.png">
      <p>
        It seems as though right now, people working with neural networks
        are happy to use conventional 2D charts to examine how their toys are
        performing.
      </p>

      <h4 id="visualizing-interactive">Interactive visualizations</h4>
      <img class="image" src="tensorflow.png">
      <h4 id="visualizing-sucks">Why those suck</h4>
      <p>
        Okay, they don't suck. Sorry for the clickbait sub-title. But they aren't
        nearly powerful enough for our purposes. I don't know for sure, but my
        intuition is that the current tools used for working with neural nets fall
        short when they're being used by a <em>general</em> intelligence.
        The interactive visualizations are neat, but so far it seems as though they
        are just used for demonstration purposes, and aren't nearly powerful enough
        to be used in a real life project.
      </p>
      <p>
        They give us some clues, however, as to some of the characteristics that
        good tools used to interact with a human-like AGI might have:
        <ul>
          <li>You can filter stuff</li>
          <li>You can change parameters directly</li>
          <li>You can play back stuff that has happened</li>
          <li>You can do some fourth thing</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
