            <h1>Description</h1>
              <p>
                ❄Flaky Survey is a survey app that lets users create surveys
                and share them with other users through a public link. Users who
                have completed a survey can later go back and change their answers.

            The app is expected to be designed and built in <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>,
            following the principles covered in
            <a href="http://www.poodr.com/">
              "Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby" by Sandi Metz
            </a>,
            but any similar framework such as Django is also acceptable.
            It can be created as either a single- or multi-page app. The code should be
            hosted on Github, and it should be relatively easy for another user
            to clone the repo and launch the app.
          </p>

          <p>
            Users can create <strong>Surveys</strong> that can be shared with
            other users. Users who have responded to a survey should be able to
            edit their answers after submitting.
          </p>
          <h3 id="creating">Creating a survey</h3>
          <p>
            The Survey creator should be able to add <strong>Questions</strong>
            with one of the following answer types:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Plain text</li>
            <li>Multiple choice (select one)</li>
            <li>Multiple choice (select many)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 id="sharing">Sharing a survey</h3>
          <p>
            When a survey is created, a public link is generated that lets the
            survey creator share the survey. Only users who are signed in may
            respond to the survey.
          </p>

          <h3 id="responding">Responding to a survey</h3>
          <p>
            When a user visits a survey belonging to another user, they can
            fill in answers to each question and submit their results at the end.
          </p>
          <p>
            If they revisit the public link for a survey that they have already
            responded to, the survey is populated with their previous answers.
            They can make any changes that they like, and submit again like normal.
          </p>

          <h3 id="results">Viewing survey results</h3>
          <p>
            Each survey has its own <strong>Results Page</strong> where the responses
            for each question are tallied, or in the case of text responses,
            listed in a way that is easy to browse.
          </p>

          <p>
            The app should be unit tested using RSpec or a similar testing
            framework. It should be fairly easy to see how the app works
            internally just by looking at the unit tests.
          </p>

          <h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
          <hr class="line" />
          <p>
            Documentation should consist of, at least, a readme file that explains
            installation, configuration, and basic usage of the app.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any public interface methods should also be documented. This documentation
            can live either in the Readme, or externally, such as in a Github wiki
            or a document generator like <a href="http://yardoc.org/">Yard</a>.
            The Readme file should contain links to any external documentation.
